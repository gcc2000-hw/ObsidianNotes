- The game world is an artificial world in which the game event happen. Mostly, a game world is designed by game designer manually. However, the problem will occur if the game world scale is vast. The longer the development of the game, time and cost will increase. While to finish the game does not take a long time. ref from E. Adams, Fundamentals of Game Design 2nd Edition, 2nd ed.

- In recent years, attention-based large language models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm, demonstrating surprisingly high performance on a variety of natural language tasks. With the right tuning, LLMs have been shown to generate coherent text in a number of styles, produce working snippets of computer code, and even respond naturalistically to human questions and conversation. While the architectures underlying these models have been leveraged for tasks outside the realm of standard text generation, from music [6] to reinforcement learning [3], comparatively less effort has been spent on analyzing the capacity of the LLMs themselves to produce non-lingusitic artifacts while still leveraging their vast amounts of training data. In this paper, we investigate the ability of LLMs to generate video game levels and the extent to which truths about these models taken from natural language processing apply to this new domain.


## Precise Problem statement  :
- It is expensive in terms of time and money to design game worlds and on a lower level, scenes in a game, a patch of environment.
## Solution : 
- A possible solution would be to design a method or a model that would take text input from the user and generate a 3D scene based on the user's specifications.
