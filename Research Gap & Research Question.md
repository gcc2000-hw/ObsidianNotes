- Multiple methods have been developed to either do text to 3D transforms like CTRL-ROOM etc or 2D to 3D transforms like NeRF. But none of these methods have been used to implement scene generation but rather individual meshes. The goal is to create a method that would take in text input for example " a grassland 500x500 px wide with 50 trees and a mountain of gold at the far top right" and it would generate not only the meshes but also the whole playable landscape.
- This would aid enormously in game development by reducing the time and costs to create a large level by providing a well defined starting point for modelling the level for the developer who can fine tune it or work on the further as they wish. 
- Future developments could lead to faster generation or even perhaps a more comprehensive or advanced method or model to generate professional level meshes and environments.
- For the lack of research in this area and also how valuable of an asset this would be to the industry, research in this domain is needed.

## Research Question - Well Defined :

- Would my method or my generative model be able to correctly generate a playable and editable environment inside a game engine through just text input ?
